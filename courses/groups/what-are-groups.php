                In mathematics, a <strong>group</strong> is a finite or infinite set of elements
                equipped with a binary operation which combines any two elements of the group
                to form an element which is still on the same group in such a way that four
                fundamental conditions known as <i>group axioms</i> are met. These axioms are known as :
                  closure, associativity, the identity and the inverse property.
                 At first it might sound a bit confusing, but later on
                everything will start to make sense. Let us first break it down!
              </p>
              <h1 class="lesson_paragraph_20_margin lecture_sub_heading">Binary Operations</h1>
              <p class="lesson_paragraph_20_margin">
                Before learning what a binary operation is, you need to know what an operation is
                in the first place. Let's look at the set of the positive even numbers :
                <div>$A:\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\dots\}$</div><br>
                Now that we have the set $A$, we want to combine the elements in some way. In order to
                combine them, we use operations. An <strong>operation</strong> combines elements of a set
                to produce another element. For example in set $A$, we can do $ 2 + 4 = 6$.
              </p>
              <div class="font-16 lesson_paragraph_20_margin lesson_important_oex93model model0ex93_yellow">
                A <strong>binary operation</strong> on a set is a calculation that combines two elements of the set
                to form another element of the set.
              </div>
              <p class="lesson_paragraph_20_margin">
                Some binary operations occur naturally in mathematics. You already know a few binary operations, even
                though you might be unaware of that. For example, the operations of addition $(+)$ on the set of integers,
                $\mathbb{Z}$, is a binary operation, as it combines two integers to produce a third integer. Let's look at
                four examples below in the set of the positive integers, $\mathbb{Z_+}$ :
              </p>
              <ul class="lesson_paragraph_list">
                <li>$ 10 + 5 = 15 $</li>
                <li>$ 99 - 5 = 94 $</li>
                <li>$ 5 \times 3 = 15 $</li>
                <li>$ \dfrac{15}{3} = 5 $</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="lesson_paragraph_20_margin">
                Even though at first instance it might seem that all the examples above are using binary operations,
                they are actually not. <strong>Only</strong> addition $(+)$ and multiplication $(\times)$ are binary operations.
                Division and subtraction are not binary operations!
              </p>
              <div class="font-16 lesson_paragraph_20_margin lesson_important_oex93model model0ex93_blue">
                The <strong>order</strong> in which the elements of the set are combined in a binary operation is
                important. For example, subtraction $(-)$ is a binary operation on the set of real numbers,
                but in general $a-bâ‰ b-a$.
              </div>
              <p class="lesson_paragraph_20_margin">
                On the next lecture we will look into some examples that involve binary operations.
